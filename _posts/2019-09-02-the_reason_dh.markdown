My first blog post! *insert heart emoji*.

*DISCLAIMER: in an attempt to be creative, all my blog posts headers will look like a file name. The ".dh" stands for my initials. Ok here we go.*

Ummm, hey there reader! Guess I'll start this off by saying: THIS IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS. 

Look, I know you're not supposed to admit this sort of thing, but, i've never *actually* had a passion for software engineering or any sort of programming ðŸ¥´. Aside from some simple copying and pasting of codes I did back in MySpace days for a cool new skin to design my profile page (haha remember that?!) or some tweaking of a code for a layout on my Tumblr page, I didn't know the first thing about coding. You'd mention software engineering to me a month ago, and i'd think of The Matrix.

But what got me interested in becoming a software engineer was a simple conversation with a friend who does this for a living (he's even a "Mentor" in the company he works for). We talked about A.I. (Artificial Intelligence), how the robots are going to take over the world soon and how all us normies with regular jobs will be out of work even sooner (sort of like a human labor Dooms Day). Following a comment made by my friend I said jokingly "yeah, instead of being the people being taken over, we may as well be a part of the takeover! *evil laugh*" Then the conversation got serious. My friend then says "hey in all seriousness you should look into software engineering. I think you'd be great at it. Look into Flatiron School; they work closely with WeWork. I think you'd really like it." After some quick research, I still didn't fully understand what I was in for, but the starting salary was *very* appealing. I did more digging and I pretty much understood the gist of software development. So I took a chance... and I'm happy that I did.

The further I get into the Full Stack Web Development V7 curriculum, the more I understand what I'm studying, the more labs I pass, the more I *LEARN*... the more excited I get! We are literally learning how to talk to our computers! It is thee most intriguing thing i've ever decided to do. I am learning a whole new language here! I haven't gotten very far into the curriculum, but with what i've learned thus far I could tell this is going to be the coolest thing i've ever done. Although extremely challenging, and at times extremely frustrating, I'm excited to learn more and finish this race... See you at the finish line.
